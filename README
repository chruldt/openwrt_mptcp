First take, 0.0

patches are available for kernel 3.18 and 4.1, so you better use one of those.

This (seems to) work on 15.05, it worked on trunk as long as it was on kernel 4.1.
It still(?) seems to work there provided you have the old patches-4.1 available, but you 
obviously have to change the URL for the patch and set
KERNEL_PATCHVER:=4.1
in target/linux/[arch]/Makefile (did it for me anyway)

Might need a target/linux/[arch]/config-4.1 ?
